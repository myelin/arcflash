The RISC OS boot process
------------------------

On IOMD, execution starts at apache/RiscOS/HAL/IOMD/s/Top for initial
RPC boot code.

This calls Kernel/s/HAL

Which calls Kernel/s/NewReset

Which finally reads the ID of the language module to boot from the
CMOS (index = LanguageCMOS).  This defaults to 11, the index of the
Desktop module, and can be overridden in the project file
(e.g. BCM2835Pico replaces it with 10, the index of BASIC64).  It then
enters the module by calling SWI OS_Module with
reason=ModHandReason_Enter, module="Desktop".
