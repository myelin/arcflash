Orientation is A3000-relative:

- "Left" is the direction of pin 1 of the four ROM sockets.  "Top" is the top edge of ROM 1.  "Bottom" is the bottom edge of ROM 4.  

A3000:

- Lots of room to the left and right of bottom ROMs.

A3xx machines:

- Rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise relative to A3000 orientation.
- Plenty of room to the "left".  No room to the "right" (podule backplane).  PCB edge about 0.1" from "top".

Board placement:

- CPLD at the top left (around ROM 1 pin 1).
- USB socket at bottom left (around ROM 4 pin 1).
